                            Hello! I'm the creator of this book and a video technologist with a keen interest in Generative AI. I've always had a passion for storytelling and filmmaking, but I never quite developed the skills to create something I felt proud to share. Recently, I began experimenting with AI tools, which gave me the confidence I previously lacked. Here, I'll walk you through the entire process of how I created this book.
                        </p>
                         <sub-title-2>The Story</sub-title-2>
                         <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            The story of Stallabella was very much inspired by my own daughter's passion for play and 
                            pushing boundaries, and I can take credit for composing a prompt that led to the creation of the story.
                            However, the actual story was generated by <link-item href="https://openai.com/"></link-item> GPT-4 model.
                            It took multiple iterations of the prompt to get a story that I was happy with. The final story was generated with little to no edits required.
                            Of all the processes to create this project, this was the easiest. 
                            I've published the base prompt, scripts, and generated story on GitHub for anyone interested in exploring the process.
                            I tried to make the code as easy to follow as possible, but you'll need some familiarity with software development tools to get started.
                        </p>

                        <sub-title-2>The Book</sub-title-2>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            Assembling the book proved to be far more challenging and time-consuming than generating the story. While there may be AI tools available to assist with this process, I wasn't aware of any at the time. The story generation code does produce a Markdown file containing the story and images, but the styling of the images created by <link-item href="https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/">OpenAI's DALL-E</link-item> model lacked consistency (I was aiming for a 3D animated look). 

                            To achieve the desired images, I used the text-to-image prompts generated by the story generator and turned to <link-item href="https://www.midjourney.com/">MidJourney</link-item>. This required numerous iterations, prompt adjustments, use of the in-painting tool, and other experiments to get the images just right. Despite all the effort, the results are still not perfect. While the images are similar, they lack consistency.

                            Although I had some background in graphic design and layout tools, I was a bit out of practice. I experimented with several tools before finally settling on Apple Pages to lay out the book.

                            I was also learning about publishing books to Amazon, and made many mistakes that I had to correct with the layout. This also added to the time it took to complete the book. After trial and error, I finally got the book approved for publishing.
                        </p>
                        <sub-title-2>The Video</sub-title-2>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            Bringing the Stallabella story to life as a video was an exhilarating experience. 
                            To narrate the story, I utilized <link-item href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/tts">OpenAI's Text to Speech</link-item> model to generate the audio files from the story text.
                            This process was straightforward. Using the OpenAI Playground GUI, I copied the story text one page at a time and downloaded the audio files.
                            To animate the images, I employed <link-item href="https://runwayml.com/">RunwayML's</link-item> image-to-video tool. This AI animation tool has significantly improved over the past few years. 
                            However, it is neither fast nor cheap. Initially, I experimented with various settings to achieve specific results but found it challenging to guide the AI to produce the desired output. 
                            I was consuming credits without satisfactory results. I then decided to mostly use the default settings and let RunwayML determine the best way to animate the images.
                            After the first pass, I imported the videos and text-to-speech audio files into <link-item href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">Davinci Resolve</link-item> and began laying out the video. 
                            After reviewing the initial version, I identified areas for improvement. I returned to RunwayML, regenerated the videos, and experimented with different prompts and settings to better steer the AI.
                            I re-imported these videos into Davinci Resolve, replacing or adding them to the timeline. I also performed some time-stretching on clips that were too short to better fit the audio. 
                            I repeated this process several times until I was satisfied with the final result.
                        </p>
                        <sub-title-2>Conclusion</sub-title-2>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            Completing this project has left me with mixed emotions. On one hand, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in what I've created. On the other hand, I struggle with the notion that it wasn't entirely my work. I didn't write every word of the story, nor did I create the images; AI handled those tasks. My role was to have the idea and assemble the pieces. While I'm pleased with the outcome, I acknowledge that the final quality isn't perfect. The imperfections in the images and video are evident, and I lack the skills to correct them. 

                            I believe that as AI tools continue to evolve, the quality of their output will improve. This project has taught me that AI tools are just that—tools. It takes someone with vision and creative drive to bring an idea to life. This realization excites me about the future and the potential of AI in creative endeavors.
                            I hope this project inspires others to explore the possibilities of AI in their creative pursuits. I encourage you to experiment, learn, and create something that brings you joy and fulfillment.
